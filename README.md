## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
This was the first time that I ever used Xcode and Swift. It was awkward for me to write code that did not end in a semicolon like java. It took me some time to adjust to the layout of Xcode and Swift 
to navigate my way through all the different options that are available on the program. The video was extremely helpful with guiding me through the process of creating the basic tip calculator app. I 
attempted to implement a slider into my tip calculator app and i had some difficulty with getting the functionality to work the way that I had imagened. I was able to refer to some documenation online 
that explained the slider in more detail.
